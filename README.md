Problem Statement :
The goal of this Power BI Dashboard is to analyze the sales performance of a supermarket using the provided Sample Data enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

I created the sales dashboard in Power BI by following these steps:

-Create Columns & measures
-Create Visuals
-Format Dashboard Background
-Format Visuals

Report has multiple sections from where you can manage the data, like :
• Report data can be sliced by year, month, payment mode and sale type.
• Report has cards showing Total sales and profit.
• Report has different charts showing sales vs profit, monthly sales and also top-selling products.
• I have also included a Reset button at the top to clear all slicers.
